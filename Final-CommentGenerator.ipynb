For  min(n*p,n*(1-p)) < 10  the Inversion method is applied:    The random numbers are generated via sequential search,         starting at the lowest index k=0. The cumulative probabilities  are avoided by using the technique of chop-down.                For  min(n*p,n*(1-p)) >= 10  Acceptance Rejection is used:      The algorithm is based on a hat-function which is uniform in    the centre region and exponential in the tails.                 A triangular immediate acceptance region in the centre speeds   up the generation of binomial variates.                         If candidate k is near the mode, f(k) is computed recursively   starting at the mode m.                                         The acceptance test by Stirling's formula is modified           according to W. Hoermann (1992): The generation of binomial     random variates, to appear in J. Statist. Comput. Simul.
